# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm using **Next.js** with static generation to create a fast, SEO-friendly blog.

## Features

- Static site generation
- Markdown support with gray-matter
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Fast loading times

## Code Example

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!"
console.log(greeting)
```

Thanks for reading!
