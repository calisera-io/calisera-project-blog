# Building Static Sites with Next.js

Static sites offer incredible performance and SEO benefits. Here's why I chose Next.js for this blog.

## Benefits of Static Generation

1. **Fast Loading**: Pre-generated HTML files
2. **SEO Friendly**: Content is immediately available to crawlers
3. **Cost Effective**: Can be hosted on CDNs
4. **Secure**: No server-side vulnerabilities

## Implementation

The key is using `output: 'export'` in your Next.js configuration to generate static files that can be deployed anywhere.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: modern React development with static site performance.
